        <!--
            The Edgecase "scout" should be placed near the top of your page head,
            and should not be included in any caching mechanism (i.e., CloudFlare)
            and should not have any extra cache-busting parameters added to the URL.
            
            WHERE:
             * CLIENTNAME is the Edgecase-supplied client token
             * ENVIRONMENT is one of "staging" or "production"
        -->
        <script type="text/javascript" src="//configs.edgecasestatic.com/CLIENTNAME/ENVIRONMENT/scout.js"></script> 
        
        <!--
            The Edgecase "$CMPR.configure" call should be placed just after the "scout".
            Note that this piece of the integration code is optional; your Edgecase
            Implementation Specialist can help you determine if a "$CMPR.configure"
            call should be used on your category pages.
        
            WHERE:
             * PRODUCTID is the ID of the product currently being viewed (should match
               the product ID provided in your product feed)
             * CATEGORYID is the ID of the category for the product currently being
               viewed (should match the category ID provided in your product feed)
             * pageType is set to "product"
        -->
        <script type="text/javascript">
            $CMPR.configure({
                productID: "PRODUCTID",
                categoryID: "CATEGORYID",

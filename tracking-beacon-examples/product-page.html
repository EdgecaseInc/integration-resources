    This example shows the code necessary to utilize the Edgecase Universal Tracking
    Beacon on the product page of a retailer's website.

    On the product page, the Edgecase Universal Tracking Beacon is simply used to
    track users though the purchase funnel.

        <title>Example Edgecase Universal Tracking Beacon Integration</title>

        <!--
            The Edgecase "scout" is a small (>6k) loader for the rest of the resources
            necessary to load the Edgecase Adaptive Navigation solution.

            IMPORTANT: The scout should not be included in any caching mechanism
            (i.e., CloudFlare) and should not have any extra cache-busting parameters
            added to the URL.

            WHERE:
             * CLIENTNAME is the Edgecase-supplied client token
             * ENVIRONMENT is one of "staging" or "production"
        -->
        <script type="text/javascript" src="//configs.edgecasestatic.com/CLIENTNAME/ENVIRONMENT/scout.js"></script>

        <!--
            The Edgecase "$EC.configure" call should be placed after the scout.js loader.
            Note that this piece of the integration code is optional; your Edgecase
            Implementation Specialist can help you determine if a "$EC.configure"
            call should be used on your product pages.

            WHERE:
             * PRODUCTID is the ID of the product currently being viewed (should match
               the product ID provided in your product feed)
             * CATEGORYID is the ID of the category for the product currently being
               viewed (should match the category ID provided in your product feed)
             * pageType is set to "product"
        -->
        <script type="text/javascript">
            $EC.configure({
                productID: 'PRODUCTID',
                categoryID: 'CATEGORYID',
                pageType: 'product'
            });
        </script>

            No other Edgecase-specific code is necessary for product page integrations.

    This example shows the code necessary to utilize the Edgecase Universal Tracking
    Beacon on the transaction confirmation page of a retailer's website.

    On the transaction page, the Edgecase Universal Tracking Beacon is used to
    track users through the purchase funnel and includes transaction events sent
    to Edgecase for analytics and reporting purposes.

        <title>Example Edgecase Adaptive Navigation Integration</title>

        <!--
            The Edgecase "scout" is a small (>6k) loader for the rest of the resources
            necessary to load the Edgecase Adaptive Navigation solution.

            IMPORTANT: The scout should not be included in any caching mechanism
            (i.e., CloudFlare) and should not have any extra cache-busting parameters
            added to the URL.

            WHERE:
             * CLIENTNAME is the Edgecase-supplied client token
             * ENVIRONMENT is one of "staging" or "production"
        -->
        <script type="text/javascript" src="//configs.edgecasestatic.com/CLIENTNAME/ENVIRONMENT/scout.js"></script>

        <!--
            The Edgecase "$EC.configure" call should be placed just after the scout.js loader.
            Note that this piece of the integration code is optional; your Edgecase
            Implementation Specialist can help you determine if a "$EC.configure"
            call should be used on your transaction confirmation page.

            WHERE:
             * pageType is set to "transaction"
        -->
        <script type="text/javascript">
            $EC.configure({
                pageType: "transaction"
            });
        </script>

        <!--
            The "$EC.track" calls can be placed anywhere on your transaction page.
            These calls are necessary for proper analytics on the effectiveness of the
            Edgecase-enriched data, and are modeled in form and function after
            Google's Ecommmerce Tracking API.

    This example shows the code necessary to inject the Edgecase Adaptive Navigation
    experience on the category page of a retailer's website.

    On the category page, the Edgecase Adaptive Navigation solution will be replacing
    any native filtering and sorting options currently available, and once a user
    selects a filter from the Edgecase solution, will be re-drawing the category
    gridwall with products that match the user's selection.

        <title>Example Edgecase Integration</title>

        <!--
            The Edgecase "scout" is a small (2-3K) loader for the rest of the resources
            necessary to load the Edgecase Adaptive Navigation solution.

            IMPORTANT: On category pages, the Edgecase Adaptive Navigation solution will
            replace the default product browsing experience, and our goal is always to
            create a better experience for users. In light of this, the scout *must* be
            loaded early in your page head, should not be included in any caching
            mechanism (i.e., CloudFlare), and should not have any extra cache-busting
            parameters added to the URL.
            
            WHERE:
             * CLIENTNAME is the Edgecase-supplied client token
             * ENVIRONMENT is one of "staging" or "production"
        -->
        <script type="text/javascript" src="//configs.edgecasestatic.com/CLIENTNAME/ENVIRONMENT/scout.js"></script> 
        
        <!--
            The Edgecase "$CMPR.configure" call should be placed just after the "scout".
            Note that this piece of the integration code is optional; your Edgecase
            Implementation Specialist can help you determine if a "$CMPR.configure"
            call should be used on your category pages.
        
            WHERE:
             * CATEGORYID is the ID of the category currently being viewed (should match
               the category ID provided in your product feed)
             * pageType is set to "category"
        -->
        <script type="text/javascript">
            $CMPR.configure({
                categoryID: "CATEGORYID",
                pageType: "category"
            });
